# PoweraMPD

PoweraMPD is an Android application that acts as a virtual MPD server interface to [Poweramp](http://powerampapp.com/). It is written to act exactly like the official MPD server following the [MPD protocol](http://www.musicpd.org/doc/protocol/). As such it should work with any MPD client.
